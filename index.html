Glad you made it till here. I am Tanisha Rastogi , 1st year Mtech Student in IIT Kanpur, completing my masters in 2022(hopefully not virtually). 
I have completed my Btech from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology(now NSUT) in 2020. 
I believe that good music has healing power. It has the ability to take people out of themselves for a few hours(Elton John).
